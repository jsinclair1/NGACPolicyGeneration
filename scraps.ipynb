      "['\\nThe NGAC security model defines the conceptual framework for the specification of a wide range of access control policies. The security model is intended to facilitate the understanding and analysis of the properties afforded to protect resources. The security model is defined formally in terms of the mathematics of set theory and predicate calculus in consonance with the Z notation (see ZNOT). The formal specification allows the essential properties for the composition and working of NGAC to be statedfree from constraints on how the properties are achieved.', '\\nThe abstractions specified by the security model govern the operation of the NGAC Functional Architecture. The abstractions involve the elements, relations, and commands that are used to represent\\nsecurity policies and provide the basis for rendering access decisions. The types of abstractions that are defined herein are as follows:\\na) basic elements;\\nb) relations;\\nc) administrative commands; and\\nd) access adjudication.', '\\nUsers need to be authenticated by an authentication service before they are activated. Details of user authentication are outside of the scope of this standard. A unique identifier (user ID) distinguishes each user within the system environment. NGAC users shall be represented by a finite set of user identifiers.', '\\nObjects represent resources to which access is controlled. Resources can be logical or physical assets, such as files, messages, database records, printers, or network devices. A unique identifier (object ID) distinguishes each object within the system environment. NGAC objects shall be represented by a finite set of object identifiers.When an object is created, it is regarded as both an object and an object attribute by NGAC. That is, the identifier of the object may not only be treated as an object within NGAC relations but may also be treated as an object attribute based on its context within a relation.', 'An access right denotes an authorizable unit or measure of authority in a defined security policy. One or more access rights are required to perform an operation. Each access right is represented by a unique\\nidentifier. Access rights shall be represented by a finite set of access right identifiers. One or more access rights are required to enable an operation to be carried out.', '\\nA user attribute denotes an abstract user characteristic or property that is significant in determining authorization, such as organizational membership, geographic location, job function, or clearance level.\\nEach user attribute is identified by a unique identifier. User attributes shall be represented by a finite set of user attribute identifiers.', '\\nAn object attribute denotes an abstract object characteristic or property that is significant in determining authorization, such as relative importance, sensitivity, geographic location, or resource type. Each object attribute is identified by a unique identifier. Object attributes shall be represented by a finite set of object attribute identifiers. Every member of the set O is, by definition, also a member of OA.', '\\nA policy class denotes an affiliation of certain users, user attributes, objects, and object attributes to an access control policy. A policy class is identified by a unique identifier. Policy classes shall be represented by a finite set of policy class identifiers.', '\\nNGAC relations fall into one of two categories: configured relations or derived relations. Configured relations represent relationships among basic elements, including sets of basic elements. Configured relations are persisted at the PIP and managed through administrative actions. Derived relations are calculated from configured relations and used to render an access control decision or conduct an administrative review of the authorization state. Since they are refinements of existing information already present in configured relations, derived relations are not treated as part of the authorization state. ', '\\nThe assignment relation defines linkages among policy elements which establish the attributes of users and objects. NGAC policy elements comprise all users, user attributes, object attributes (including all objects), and policy classes. The policy element set is defined as follows: PE = U ⋃ UA ⋃ OA ⋃ PC', 'Policy element linkages denoted by assignments are directional. The first policy element of each assignment tuple is the direct ascendant of the second policy element, and the second policy element is the direct descendant of the first. A path is a sequence of policy elements in which each pair of consecutive policy elements in the sequence constitutes an assignment. Assignments between certain policy elements are also precluded, essentially distinguishing user and user attribute linkages from object and object attribute linkages.', '\\nAn object can be said to be “contained by” an object attribute if a path exists between the object and the object attribute. The Objects function represents the mapping from an object attribute to the set of objects that are contained by or denote that object attribute. Intuitively, the function Objects(oa) returns the set of objects that are contained by or possess the characteristics of the object attribute oa.', '\\nThe association relation defines an allocation of access rights among certain policy elements. Each association consists of an ordered triple of a user attribute, an access right set, and a user or object attribute. Members of an access right set are related for the purposes of access control. An access right set is identified by a unique identifier.', 'The privilege relation is derived from the association and assignment relations. Each privilege is a triple of the form user, access right, and policy element whereby an association exists for each policy class containing the policy element, such that the following is true:\\na) The user is contained by the user attribute of the association;\\nb) The policy element is contained by the attribute of the association;\\nc) The attribute of the association is contained by the policy class; and\\nd) The access right is a member of the access right set of the association.\\nThe privilege relation is a ternary relation from U to AR to PE\\\\PC. ', '\\nThis standard specifies the architecture, security model, and interfaces of the NGAC framework at a level of detail necessary to ensure its realization in different types of implementation environments at a range\\nof scalability levels. The standard also specifies key implementation aspects that enable functional entities within the architecture to operate in a correct, effective, cooperative, and accordant manner. Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a fundamental reworking of traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of the modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. NGAC is based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide access control services for different types of resources, accessed by different types of applications and users. NGAC is designed to be scalable, support multiple policies simultaneously, and remain tractable in the face of changing technology, organizational restructuring, and increasing data volumes. Functional components of the reference architecture can be supported by products from different manufacturers. NGAC diverges from traditional approaches to access control in that it defines a generic architecture separate from any particular type of policy. NGAC is not an extension or adaption of any existing access control model, but rather a redefinition of access control in terms of a fundamental and reusable set of data abstractions and functions. NGAC provides a unifying framework capable of supporting not only current access control approaches but also novel types of policy that have been conceived yet never implemented due to the lack of a suitable means of expression and enforcement.', '\\nNGAC follows an attribute-based construction in which characteristics or properties are used to control access to resources and to describe and manage policy. NGAC accommodates combinations of different policies and can support several types of policies concurrently in a manner that is both deterministic and manageable. NGAC is also suitable for applications in which some information is stored locally and some is stored in a grid or cloud, since different policies can be asserted in each context. Even more generally, NGAC supports situations in which policy determined by a central organization is able to operate concurrently with a local, specific, and more ad hoc policy.', '\\nLeast privilege is an established administrative practice of assigning users and processes the minimal authorization necessary for the performance of their job function. NGAC supports the concept of least privilege by allowing different authorizations for a user or its processes to become available at different times for the performance of different tasks. Processes acting for a user within the user’s session can be restricted to a subset of the user’s authorization, allowing them to be attenuated at a granularity below that of the user.', 'This standard specifies the architecture, security model, and interfaces of the NGAC framework at a level of detail necessary to ensure its realization in different types of implementation environments at a range of scalability levels.', 'Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a fundamental reworking of traditional access controls to meet the needs of the modern, distributed, and interconnected enterprise. NGAC provides a unifying framework\\ncapable of supporting both current and novel types of access control policies simultaneously. It also defines access control in terms of a fundamental and reusable set of data abstractions and functions,\\nfollowing an attribute-based access control model in which authorizations are defined in terms of attributes. Security-relevant properties of users, processes, and objects (e.g., role, sensitivity, affiliation, and class), and also of the computational environment (e.g., time of day and threat level) can be expressed as attributes.', 'Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a reinvention of traditional access control into a form that suits the needs of the modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise.

The functional architecture can be implemented in a number of ways, and it allows different types of access control schemes to be realized using a common set of services.', '', 'The first two information flows listed above correspond respectively to the two kinds of accesses supported by NGAC: resource access and administration access. A resource access is the only means by which users may gain access to resources governed by NGAC. Similarly, an administration access is the only means by which users may gain access to policy information. The third information flow, an event context flow, applies only to a system for which an EPP is present and is a concomitant of a successful resource or administration access.', 'A resource access is the only way by which users shall gain access to resources. An administration access is the only way by which users shall gain access to policy information. A user may be associated with one or more processes, while a process shall be associated with just one user. Requests from a user’s process to access resources or policy information need to be submitted under an established session. A user shall not have more than one session active at any time. An authenticated user shall establish a session with a PEP prior to any of its processes submitting an access request. All of a user’s processes shall use the PEP to which the user has formed a session to access resources or policy information.', '\\nTo determine whether an access request can be granted, the access decision function requires a mapping from the operation to the sequence of possible access right sets that the process’s user needs to hold over the arguments of the operation.', 'The NGAC security model is specified utilizing a single data store in which the policy is maintained, and modifications to the policy take immediate effect. While the model captures the required behavior of\\napplied policy updates, it does not address the more general issue of ensuring that the updates are of high-caliber. Because updates have a direct impact on the results of the access decision function, it\\nwould be useful to provide one or more means to vet intended updates before they are applied to the active policy.', 'A policy management application can be an important tool in understanding policy abstractions and the impact that policy settings have on controlling behavior. A policy management tool should be able to\\nscreen proposed changes before they are applied to verify that they are well-formed and do not produce inconstancies in the policy. Graphical renditions are an effective aid in comprehending and administering\\npolicy for which NGAC is well-suited.', 'Establishing separate, distinct spaces for creating and testing policy revisions before they are activated can also prove useful in practice. For example, two policy stores could be maintained: one for the test policy and one for the active policy. The active policy store is used to compute runtime access decisions, while the test policy store is used to apply revisions to a copy of the active policy for vetting. Once vetting\\nof a test policy is complete, it can replace the active policy. Some means would also need to be established to transition the test policy to the active policy in a synchronized fashion that avoids disrupting operations.', '', 'User specification: If the user specification is present, it denotes the processes of a specific user, any user, or any user from a set of users and/or user attributes, or a specific process specified through its identifier.

We first create the policy class \"policyclass1\" and then create the user attribute \"userattribute1\", object attribute \"objectattribute1\", and assign \"userattribute1\" to \"userattribute2\". The permissions of \"userattribute2\" are inherited by \"userattribute1\". Then, we create the user \"user1\" with attributes \"userattribute1\" and \"userattribute2\". We then associate \"userattribute1\" and \"objectattribute1\" with \"accessright1\" and \"accessright2\", respectively. Finally, we grant the permission to access \"accessright1\" and \"accessright2\" on \"objectattribute1\" to any user with \"userattribute1\".\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n'"

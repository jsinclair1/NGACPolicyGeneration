The formal specification allows the essential properties for the composition and working of NGAC to be statedfree from constraints on how the properties are achieved.', '\\nThe abstractions specified by the security model govern the operation of the NGAC Functional Architecture.

That is, the identifier of the object may not only be treated as an object within NGAC relations but may also be treated as an object attribute based on its context within a relation.', 'An access right denotes an authorizable unit or measure of authority in a defined security policy.

Configured relations represent relationships among basic elements, including sets of basic elements. Configured relations are persisted at the PIP and managed through administrative actions. Derived relations are calculated from configured relations and used to render an access control decision or conduct an administrative review of the authorization state. Since they are refinements of existing information already present in configured relations, derived relations are not treated as part of the authorization state. ', '\\nThe assignment relation defines linkages among policy elements which establish the attributes of users and objects.

The standard also specifies key implementation aspects that enable functional entities within the architecture to operate in a correct, effective, cooperative, and accordant manner. Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a fundamental reworking of traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of the modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. NGAC is based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide access control services for different types of resources, accessed by different types of applications and users. NGAC is designed to be scalable, support multiple policies simultaneously, and remain tractable in the face of changing technology, organizational restructuring, and increasing data volumes. Functional components of the reference architecture can be supported by products from different manufacturers. NGAC diverges from traditional approaches to access control in that it defines a generic architecture separate from any particular type of policy. NGAC is not an extension or adaption of any existing access control model, but rather a redefinition of access control in terms of a fundamental and reusable set of data abstractions and functions. NGAC provides a unifying framework capable of supporting not only current access control approaches but also novel types of policy that have been conceived yet never implemented due to the lack of a suitable means of expression and enforcement.', '\\nNGAC follows an attribute-based construction in which characteristics or properties are used to control access to resources and to describe and manage policy. NGAC accommodates combinations of different policies and can support several types of policies concurrently in a manner that is both deterministic and manageable. NGAC is also suitable for applications in which some information is stored locally and some is stored in a grid or cloud, since different policies can be asserted in each context. Even more generally, NGAC supports situations in which policy determined by a central organization is able to operate concurrently with a local, specific, and more ad hoc policy.', '\\nLeast privilege is an established administrative practice of assigning users and processes the minimal authorization necessary for the performance of their job function. NGAC supports the concept of least privilege by allowing different authorizations for a user or its processes to become available at different times for the performance of different tasks. Processes acting for a user within the user’s session can be restricted to a subset of the user’s authorization, allowing them to be attenuated at a granularity below that of the user.', 'This standard specifies the architecture, security model, and interfaces of the NGAC framework at a level of detail necessary to ensure its realization in different types of implementation environments at a range of scalability levels.', 'Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) is a fundamental reworking of traditional access controls to meet the needs of the modern, distributed, and interconnected enterprise.

An authenticated user shall establish a session with a PEP prior to any of its processes submitting an access request. All of a user’s processes shall use the PEP to which the user has formed a session to access resources or policy information.', '\\nTo determine whether an access request can be granted, the access decision function requires a mapping from the operation to the sequence of possible access right sets that the process’s user needs to hold over the arguments of the operation.', 'The NGAC security model is specified utilizing a single data store in which the policy is maintained, and modifications to the policy take immediate effect. While the model captures the required behavior of\\napplied policy updates, it does not address the more general issue of ensuring that the updates are of high-caliber. Because updates have a direct impact on the results of the access decision function, it\\nwould be useful to provide one or more means to vet intended updates before they are applied to the active policy.', 'A policy management application can be an important tool in understanding policy abstractions and the impact that policy settings have on controlling behavior. A policy management tool should be able to\\nscreen proposed changes before they are applied to verify that they are well-formed and do not produce inconstancies in the policy. Graphical renditions are an effective aid in comprehending and administering\\npolicy for which NGAC is well-suited.', 'Establishing separate, distinct spaces for creating and testing policy revisions before they are activated can also prove useful in practice. For example, two policy stores could be maintained: one for the test policy and one for the active policy. The active policy store is used to compute runtime access decisions, while the test policy store is used to apply revisions to a copy of the active policy for vetting. Once vetting\\nof a test policy is complete, it can replace the active policy. Some means would also need to be established to transition the test policy to the active policy in a synchronized fashion that avoids disrupting operations.', '', 'User specification: If the user specification is present, it denotes the processes of a specific user, any user, or any user from a set of users and/or user attributes, or a specific process specified through its identifier.
